# Eduroam Configuration for JKUAT (Arch Linux)

This folder contains the configuration files required to successfully connect to the `eduroam` WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi network at JKUAT using `iwd` (iNet Wireless Daemon).

Since `NetworkManager` is configured to use the `iwd` backend on this machine, using NetworkManager's GUI for enterprise connections can sometimes glitch out and modify backend settings incorrectly (which previously caused system-wide Wi-Fi failures). 

By supplying the configuration directly to `iwd`, we bypass any GUI bugs and ensure a seamless, native connection.

## Files in this Directory

- `eduroam.8021x`: The template configuration file that `iwd` reads to understand the security protocols (PEAP/MSCHAPV2) and your credentials.
- `install_eduroam.sh`: A helper script that safely copies the configuration into the protected system directory (`/var/lib/iwd/`) with the correct permissions.

## How to Set It Up

### Step 1: Add Your Credentials
Open the `eduroam.8021x` file in your preferred text editor.
Find the following lines and replace the placeholder text with your actual JKUAT credentials:
```ini
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=your_student_id@jkuat.ac.ke
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=your_password
```
*(Note: Do not change the outer `EAP-Identity=anonymous@jkuat.ac.ke` unless JKUAT specifically requires it to be your actual email).*

### Step 2: Install the Profile
Run the installer script. Because `iwd` configuration files contain plain-text passwords, the system directory requires root access (`sudo`) to protect it.

```bash
sudo ./install_eduroam.sh
```
This script will copy the file to `/var/lib/iwd/eduroam.8021x`, lock down its read permissions, and restart the `iwd` service.

### Step 3: Connect
The next time you are on campus and in range of the `eduroam` network, `iwd` should automatically authenticate and connect in the background!

## Troubleshooting CA Certificates

In some instances, the university RADIUS server refuses the connection unless you explicitly validate their Certificate Authority (CA). If the connection fails silently after completing Steps 1 and 2:

1. Download the JKUAT CA Certificate (`JKUAT_CA.pem`) from the university's IT portal or from `cat.eduroam.org`.
2. Move it to a secure location (e.g., `/etc/ssl/certs/JKUAT_CA.pem`).
3. Open `eduroam.8021x` and uncomment the CA Certificate line:
   ```ini
   EAP-PEAP-CACert=/etc/ssl/certs/JKUAT_CA.pem
   ```
4. Run `sudo ./install_eduroam.sh` again to apply the updated configuration.

## Arch Linux (MacBook Pro) Troubleshooting Guide

When connecting an Arch Linux system on a MacBook Pro (Broadcom BCM43602 / `brcmfmac`) to JKUAT's Eduroam network, follow these troubleshooting steps for common issues:

### Issue 1: Infrastructure Failure (The "Campus AP / Library Bug")
**Symptom:** The connection is rejected repeatedly or hangs during association, even though credentials and CA certificates are 100% correct.
**Cause:** Certain Wi-Fi Access Points on campus (notably in high-density areas like the library) periodically lose connection to the campus RADIUS authentication server or drop EAP handshakes.
**Solution:** 
1. Move to a different campus building or location (e.g., Science Complex or Hall) where Eduroam is actively authenticating.
2. If it connects immediately elsewhere, your configuration is correct and the issue was an unresponsive local AP.

### Issue 2: Temporary Account Lockout
**Symptom:** Authentication fails immediately (`EAP authentication failed` or `Access-Reject`), even with known valid credentials.
**Cause:** JKUAT's Active Directory server automatically locks student accounts for 30–60 minutes after consecutive failed authentication attempts from any device.
**Solution:** 
1. Disconnect Wi-Fi on all devices (laptop, phone, tablet) to stop repeated auth requests.
2. Wait 60 minutes for the directory lockout timer to expire.
3. Reconnect using your verified student portal username and password.

### Issue 3: Driver & PMF / 802.11w Conflicts
**Symptom:** `wpa_supplicant` or `iwd` reports `CTRL-EVENT-ASSOC-REJECT status_code=16` or driver deauthentication loops.
**Cause:** Protected Management Frames (PMF / 802.11w) or 802.11r Fast BSS Transition incompatibilities with the Broadcom `brcmfmac` driver.
**Solution:**
1. Ensure the `brcmfmac` module is loaded with `feature_disable=0x82000` in `/etc/modprobe.d/brcmfmac.conf`.
2. In NetworkManager, set `802-11-wireless-security.pmf 1` (optional) and `802-11-wireless-security.key-mgmt wpa-eap`.
3. If using `iwd`, ensure file permissions in `/var/lib/iwd/` are strictly `root:root` with `chmod 600`.

### Issue 4: CA Certificate Verification & Domain Match
**Symptom:** EAP-TTLS or PEAP outer TLS handshake fails with certificate validation errors.
**Solution:**
1. Verify the JKUAT CA certificate exists at `/etc/ssl/certs/jkuat_ca.pem` (or `/var/lib/iwd/jkuat_ca.pem` for iwd) and has read permissions (`chmod 644`).
2. Ensure the domain match is configured as `jkuat.ac.ke`.
3. Check detailed authentication logs in real-time:
   - For `iwd`: `journalctl -u iwd -f`
   - For `NetworkManager`: `journalctl -u NetworkManager -f`
